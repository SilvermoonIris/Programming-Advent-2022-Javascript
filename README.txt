This is a repo containing my attempts at solving however many "advent of code 2022" coding challenges/puzzles as my brain can handle while I try to find a job 
DO NOT expect quality code here... I am trying to get a general picture of Javascript (which I had never before used), 
after the better part of 6 months of not coding ANYTHING AT ALL.

I'll try to leave a text file with the advent days. Explaining a bit of my objectives and any quirks of the exercise,
along with any tired ramblings I feel like writing.

Here's an excerpt of Day 1's ramblings.

"
I'm uploading this disaster of a coding exercise to leave a paper trail...
I want to have a reason to spend this much time understanding computers again.
Employment can't come soon enough. -_-
"

Enjoy? IDK... Why are you even here? Not that I'm complaining, just... there's better things to do.
