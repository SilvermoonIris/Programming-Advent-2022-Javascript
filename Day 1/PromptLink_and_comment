I'm uploading this disaster of a coding exercise to leave a paper trail...
I want to have a reason to spend this much time understanding computers again.
Employment can't come soon enough. -_-

If the code seems like it is based on something else, that is because it is.
A good friend of mine is helping me get started with Javascript, and giving me a refresher on programming.
I really struggled with this one, thanks to the stubborness of my younger years. Pre-made functions and methods are your friend
No need to re-invent boiling water every time you want to code something.
HOWEVER, I did reinvent the For... Of... loop in my dumbed solution 
(but that's why it's 'dumbed'... because it's easier for me to understand each part of the looping code with clear iterations and increments)
